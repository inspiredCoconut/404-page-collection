# Error Page Collection

This project is a collection of custom 404 error pages. Each page is designed to provide a unique and user-friendly experience when a user encounters a "Page Not Found" error. The goal is to make error pages more engaging and helpful, rather than just displaying a standard error message.

## Features

- A variety of 404 error page designs
- Easy to integrate into existing projects
- Customizable to fit different website themes
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Usage

To use one of the error pages in your project, simply copy the HTML, CSS, and any associated assets into your project directory. Update the links and paths as necessary to ensure everything works correctly.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you have a unique 404 error page design that you'd like to share, please submit a pull request.
